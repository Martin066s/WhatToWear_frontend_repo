WhatToWear recommends you clothes based on entered temperature. In later versions should recommend clothes based on realtime weather data from weather API.

The frontend is responsible for client-side rendering and sends HTTP requests to the backend for storing or receiving data. 

On the settings screen the user can create and delete clothes. On the main screen the user can enter a temperature and gets a clothing recommendation based on his saved preferences (e.g. maximum temperature)
